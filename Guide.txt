Guide to Using the Modified EEG Plot Function

1. Main Function: eeginplot.m
The main function is eeginplot, which is a modified version of the original MATLAB eegplot function. This enhanced version includes additional features for partial interpolation.

2. Functionality of WinRej.m
The WinRej function is designed to revert the values of selected channels in highlighted segments to be interpolated.
Inside WinRej, another function, segment_interpolation.m , is called to handle the interpolation process in a for loop.

3. segment_interpolation
This function interpolates each segment based on the associated selected channels derived from the WinRej values. 
It ensures precise handling of the selected data for interpolation.

4. Plugin Integration
The following two functions are required to call eeginplot from a plugin:
	eegplugin_partial_interpolation.m
	highlight_interpolate_gui.m


5. Setting Up the Plugin
To integrate the plugin into EEGLAB:
Place the .m files (including eegplugin_partial_interpolation.m and highlight_interpolate_gui.m) in the directory:
MATLAB/toolbox/eeglab/plugins/partial_interpolation

Use MATLAB's setpath function to add this directory to the MATLAB path.


6. Accessing the Plugin in EEGLAB
After setting up the plugin, it will appear under the Tools menu in EEGLAB. 
You can now use it for advanced EEG data processing and partial interpolation tasks.
